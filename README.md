# Earthquake Data Pipeline

## A modular asynchronous pipeline in Python that collects recent earthquake data from the USGS API, saves it as a GeoJSON file, and uploads it to a GCS bucket.

This project was created as part of my data engineering portfolio to demonstrate practical skills in:

- Asynchronous data fetching 
- Modular pipeline design in Python
- Working with environment-based configuration
- Processing and storing structured data (GeoJSON)
- Integrating with Google Cloud Storage 

## ðŸŒ± Future ideas

- Auto daily run 
- Add visual **earthquake dashboard** 
- Implement **email or SMS alerts** for strong events
- Add **daily statistics** for magnitude distribution
- Integrate with **BigQuery** for long-term storage and querying
- Add unit tests and CI/CD workflows

This project, like many others in my portfolio, was created as a personal initiative in my free time.
Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by natural forces â€” not just earthquakes, but all kinds of extreme phenomena that show how powerful and unpredictable nature can be. :)
